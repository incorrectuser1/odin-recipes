            <h3>Crispy lumpia</h3>
                <p>This is a traditional Filipino recipe for <strong>lumpia</strong>, or fried spring rolls. They're made with paper-thin lumpia wrappers</p><p>and filled with a savory mixture of ground pork, cabbage, and other vegetables. Serve lumpia as a side dish or appetizer with a sweet chili dipping sauce.</p>
            <h3>ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 lbs Ground beef</li>
                    <li>1 1/4 cups Carrots</li>
                    <li>4 cloves Garlic</li>
                    <li>1 Leeks, stem</li>
                    <li>1 Soy sauce or salt, dark</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp Cooking oil</li>
                   
                </ul>
            <h3>Recipe Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                   <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add pork; cook and stir until crumbly and no pink is showing, 5 to 7 minutes.</p><p>Remove pork from the pan and set aside. Drain grease from the pan, leaving just a thin coating.</li>     
                   <li>Assemble lumpia: Place 3 heaping tablespoons of filling diagonally near one corner of a lumpia wrapper, leaving a 1 1/2 inch space at both ends. Fold the side along the length of the filling over the filling, tuck in both ends, and roll neatly and tightly to close.</li>
                        <p>Moisten the other side of the wrapper with water to seal the edge. Transfer to a plate and cover with plastic wrap to retain moisture. Repeat to assemble remaining lumpia.</p>
                    <li>Heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Slide 3 to 4 lumpia into the hot oil, making sure the seams are facing down. Fry, turning occasionally, until all sides are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat to fry remaining lumpia. Serve immediately.</li>
                </ol>
